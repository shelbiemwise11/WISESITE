      <h1>My First Build</h1>
    

      <p>Finally got my first build done this summer. My main resource was PcPartPicker. 
		This site allows you to confirm all parts will
		be compatible and as well gives you a list of places to purchase with their current prices. 
		I did purchase my grpahics card used for $100, and also note
		that I have not yet purchased the optical drive that is on my pcPartPicker list.
		Still debating if I really need one or not.
		<br><br>Here is the link to my direct list from the site:

	<p> I did also buy some led fans, the pink one I got off of Amazon, and the rainbow one I bought from a local computer store. 
		The case itself came with two fans - which were very quite - my new ones are slightly louder.
	</p>
	
	<p> So far I have had zero issues with this build. Starts up in 10-12 seconds, everything loads fast, stays cool. 
		Love every thing about it!!
